printf
The printf project is a collaboration between Ama Appiah-Danquah and King-David Gyamfi Akuoko, students of ALXSE. 
We look to create a function, "_printf" which imitates the actual printf fucntion in C programming.

The following file functions will be created

_printf.c- a function that performed formatted output conversions and prints data

main.h- Header file which houses all prototypes

get_print_func.c- A pointer to a function that selects that right function to execute

print_buf.c- a function that concatenates buffer characters
